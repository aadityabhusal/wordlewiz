# wordle
An approach to solving wordle puzzles

# This project is being modified into a wordle solver.

# Tasks
- Get the list of most used letters in 5 lettered words
- Optimize the function from O(n^2) to O(n*log(n)) or if possible O(n)
- Make the function more generic to make it possible to add reserved/fixed words
